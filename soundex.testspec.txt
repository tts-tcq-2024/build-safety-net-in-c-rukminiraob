Test Suite Name: SoundexTestsuite
Test Case 1: ReplacesConsonantsWithAppropriateDigits

Objective:
Verify that the generateSoundex function correctly replaces consonants with their appropriate Soundex digits for various input strings, adhering to Soundex encoding rules.

Preconditions:

    The generateSoundex function is available and functional.
    The output Soundex code should be 4 characters long.

Test Procedure:
For each input string:

    Pass the input string and an empty array (soundex[5]) to the generateSoundex function.
    Assert that the returned Soundex code matches the expected result.

Test Data:
Input	   Expected Output
"AX"	     "A200"
"Robert"	 "R163"
"Rupert"	 "R163"
"Rubin"	   "R150"
"Ashcraft" "A261"
"Ashcroft" "A261"

Expected Result:
The function returns the correct Soundex code for each string.

Test Case 2: NonAlphabetCharacter
Objective:
Verify that the generateSoundex function correctly handles input strings containing non-alphabetic characters by ignoring them and generating the appropriate Soundex code.

Preconditions:

    The generateSoundex function is available and functional.
    Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored during Soundex code generation.

Test Procedure:

    Pass the input string containing a non-alphabetic character ("A#hcroft") and an empty array (soundex[5]) to the generateSoundex function.
    Assert that the returned Soundex code matches the expected result.

Test Data:
Input	Expected Output
"A#hcroft"	"A261"

Expected Result:
The function ignores the # symbol and generates the correct Soundex code for the remaining alphabetic characters.
